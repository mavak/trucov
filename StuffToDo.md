# What is this page for? #
This page lists stuff to do in the future. Any time you think of something you want to do (or change) in the future. Put it in this page right away before you forget. That way, we'll be able to track changes we want to make.

Separate Tasks by a newline. Include the filename and (if possible) function name.

# Stuff to Do #

1) task.cpp : task\_example() : Delete this stupid example.<br>
2) All source files : No relative paths for includes. "../dog.h" cannot happen. Use the -I in the cmake compile file.<br>
3) main.cpp : Put command functions into separate file (or function). (e.g. do_report, do_dot in commands.cpp and commands.h)
